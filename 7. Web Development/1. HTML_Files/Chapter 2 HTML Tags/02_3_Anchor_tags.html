<!-- 
Anchor tag <a>:
The <a> tag (anchor tag) in HTML is used to create a hyperlink on the webpage. This hyperlink is used to link the webpage to other web pages or some section of the same web page. It’s either used to provide an absolute reference or a relative reference as its “href” value.
<a> attributes:
1. href: (Hypertext reference) The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
Tip: You can use href="#top" or href="#" to link to the top of the current page!

2. rel: It is used to specify the relation between the current document and the linked document.
3. target: It specifies the target link.

1. Absolute link or URL: An absolute URL is the full URL, including protocol ( http / https ), the optional subdomain (e.g. www ), domain (example.com), and path (which includes the directory and slug). Absolute URLs provide all the available information to find the location of a page.

2. Relative link or URL: A relative link is any link that shows the current URL's relation to the linked page's URL. Instead of having the whole reference URL in the h-ref tag, relative links only show the relative link paths, as their name suggests.
