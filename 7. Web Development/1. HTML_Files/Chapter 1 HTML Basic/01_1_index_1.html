Hypertext:
Hypertext refers to text that contains hyperlinks. It is a non-linear way of presenting information where text contains links to other texts or multimedia content, allowing users to navigate through related pieces of information in a non-sequential manner. HTML documents are often referred to as hypertext documents because they contain hyperlinks that enable users to navigate between different sections of the document or to external resources.
eg.
<p>
  Welcome to our website! Check out our <a href="products.html">products</a> or <a href="about.html">learn more about us</a>.
</p>

Hyperlink: 
A hyperlink is an element in an electronic document that links to another place in the same document or to an entirely different document. In HTML, hyperlinks are created using the <a> (anchor) element, and they typically appear as text or images that users can click on to navigate to a different location. Hyperlinks are the interactive elements that enable navigation between different web pages or sections within the same page.
eg.
<a href="https://www.google.com">Click here to visit google.com</a>
