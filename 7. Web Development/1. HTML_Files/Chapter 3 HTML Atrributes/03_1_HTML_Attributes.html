<!-- HTML Attributes: 
All HTML elements have attributes that will provide additional information about that particular element. It takes 2 parameters, ie, a name & a value which define the properties of the element and are placed inside the element tag.
Attributes that set a value always have:
1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

There are two main types of attributes in HTML:
1. Global attributes: Global attributes can be used with any HTML element.
Some common global attributes include:
id - Specifies a unique identifier for the element.
class - Specifies a CSS class for the element.
style - Specifies inline CSS styles for the element.
lang - Specifies the language of the element's content.
title - Specifies a title for the element.
dir - Specifies the direction of the element's content.
hidden - Specifies that the element is not yet, or is no longer, relevant.
spellcheck - Specifies whether the element is to have its spelling and grammar checked or not.

2. Element-specific attributes can only be used with specific HTML elements. Some common element-specific attributes include:
src - Specifies the source of an image or media file.
href - Specifies the URL of a link.
alt - Specifies an alternate text for an image or media file.
name - Specifies the name of an input field.
value - Specifies the value of an input field.

In addition to these two main types of attributes, there are also a number of other types of attributes, such as:
# Events attributes - These attributes are used to handle events, such as clicks, hovers, and scrolls.
# Metadata attributes - These attributes provide information about the element, such as its author, title, and description.
# Microdata attributes - These attributes are used to add structured data to HTML elements, which can be used by search engines and other applications.

Some more used html attributes.

selected: This attribute specifies that an option is selected in a drop-down list by default.
disabled: This attribute disables an element, so that it cannot be interacted with.
readonly: This attribute makes an element read-only, so that its value cannot be changed.
required: This attribute specifies that a form field must be filled in before the form can be submitted.
