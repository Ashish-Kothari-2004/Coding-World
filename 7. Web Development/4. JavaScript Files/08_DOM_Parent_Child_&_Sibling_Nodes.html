What is DOM ?
DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface that represents structured documents like HTML and XML as a tree of objects. It defines how to access, manipulate, and modify document elements using scripting languages like JavaScript.
So basically Document Object Model is an API that represents and interacts with HTML or XML documents.
The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard and it defines a standard for accessing documents.
The W3C Dom standard is divided into three different parts:
1. Core DOM – standard model for all document types
2. XML DOM – standard model for XML documents
3. HTML DOM – standard model for HTML documents

Why is DOM Required ?
HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior to our web pages. When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the JavaScript can not understand the HTML document directly. So it interprets and interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), which is created by the browser based on the HTML document.
DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a tree-like structure composed of objects. JavaScript can not understand the tags(<h1>H</h1>) in HTML document but can understand object h1 in DOM.
JavaScript interprets DOM easily, using it as a bridge to access and manipulate the elements. DOM Javascript allow access to each of the objects (h1, p, etc) by using different functions.
