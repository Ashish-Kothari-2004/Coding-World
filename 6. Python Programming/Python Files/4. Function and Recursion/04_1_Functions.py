# Python Function: Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.

# Some Benefits of Using Functions
# 1. Increase Code Readability
# 2. Increase Code Reusability

def gmean(a, b):
    print("The geometric mean of the given number is: ", (a*b)/(a+b))

def isGreater(a, b):
    pass # Function body will be defined later
    
gmean(2, 3)
gmean(8, 8)
