# Comments in Python are the lines in the code that are ignored by the interpreter during the execution of the program.
# There are three types of comments in Python:

# 1. Single line Comments 
# i) Using hashtag symbol # 
# ii) Using String Literals

# 2. Multiline String (Python does not provide the facility for multi-line comments. However, there are indeed many ways to create multi-line comments.)
# i) With Multiple Hashtags (#)
# ii) Using String Literals 

# 3. Docstring Comments
# Python docstring is the string literals with triple quotes that are appeared right after the function.
# It is used to associate documentation that has been written with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods.
# It is added right below the functions, modules, or classes to describe what they do. In Python, the docstring is then made available via the __doc__ attribute.

# Why are Comments Used in Python?
# 1. Enhance code readability.
# 2. Explaining code to other.
# 3. Understanding code if studied after some time.
# 4. Documenting the steps and needs for a function.
# 5. Sharing code with fellow developers.
# 6. Collaborating with multiple people.
