# Methods of set: 
# 1. add(): Insertion in the set is done through the set.add() function.
# 2. union(): Two sets can be merged using union() function or | operator.
# 3. intersection(): This can be done through intersection() or & operator.
# 4. intersection_update(): Updates the existing caller set with the intersection of sets
# 5. clear(): set clear() method empties the whole set inplace.
# 6. update(): Adds elements to the set
# 7. difference_update(): Updates the existing caller set with the difference between two sets
# 8. frozenset(): Return an immutable frozenset object
# 9. remove():	Removes the element from the set, and throws error if element is not present in the set
# 10. discard(): Removes the element from the set
# 11. pop(): Returns and removes a random element from the set
# 12. copy(): Returns a shallow copy of the set
# 13. isdisjoint():	Checks whether the sets are disjoint or not
# 14. issubset(): Returns True if all elements of a set A are present in another set B
# 15. issuperset(): Returns True if all elements of a set A occupies set B
# 16. difference(): To find differences between sets, this is done through difference() or â€“ operator.
# 17. symmetric_difference(): Returns a set which is the symmetric difference between the two sets
# 18. symmetric_difference_update(): Updates the existing caller set with the symmetric difference of sets
