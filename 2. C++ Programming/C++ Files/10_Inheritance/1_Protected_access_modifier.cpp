// Protected: The protected access modifier is similar to the private access modifier in the sense that it canâ€™t be accessed outside of its class unless with the help of a friend class. The difference is that the class members declared as Protected can be accessed by any subclass (derived class) of that class as well. 
// Note: This access through inheritance can alter the access modifier of the elements of base class in derived class depending on the mode of Inheritance.
