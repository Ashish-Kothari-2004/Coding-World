// Modules --> A module is a set of source code files that are compiled independently of the translation units that import them. Modules eliminate or reduce many of the problems associated with the use of header files. They often reduce compilation times.

// Control Structures --> Control Structures are just a way to specify flow of control in programs. Any algorithm or program can be more clear and understood if they use self-contained modules called as logic or control structures. It basically analyzes and chooses in which direction a program flows based on certain parameters or conditions. There are three basic types of logic, or flow of control, known as:

// 1.Sequence logic, or sequential flow or sequence structure.
// 2.Selection logic, or conditional flow or selection structure.
// 3.Iteration logic, or repetitive flow or loop structure.
