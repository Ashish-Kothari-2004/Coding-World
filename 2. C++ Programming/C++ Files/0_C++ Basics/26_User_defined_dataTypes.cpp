// User Defined Data Types --> Data types define the type of value or data a variable holds in it. Built-in Data types are used to store simple data types such as integers, decimal point values, characters, etc. But Data also occurs in a wide variety of formats. High Complexity of data can occur often. For this purpose programming languages provides us with User-Defined Data types that are created by the users/programmers as per the data complexity requirements.

// For every Programming language, there are different types of User-Defined data types. Let us look at a few of them :

// 1.Class – A User-defined data type that holds data members and functions whose access can be specified as private, public, or protected. It uses the ‘class’ keyword for defining the data structure.

// 2.Structure – A structured data type is used to group data items of different types into a single type. For Eg. Structure can be Address, in which it further contains information such as Flat number, Building name, street, city, state, pin code, etc. It is defined by using the ‘struct’

// 3 Union – Union is a type of data structure where all the members of that union share the same memory location. If any changes made in the Union, it will be visible to others as well. The ‘union’ keyword is used to define this type of User-defined data type.

// 4.Enumeration (enum) – It helps assign names to integer constants in the program. The keyword ‘enum’ is used. It is used to increase the readability of the code.

// 5.Typedef – Typedef defines a new name for an existing data type. It does not create a new data class. It makes code readability easy and gives more clarity to the user.
