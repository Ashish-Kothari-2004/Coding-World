Data Structure - A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. 

Types of data structures...............
1. Linear data structure - Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. eg. Array, linked list, stack, queue.

a) Static data structure - Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
eg. Array

b) Dynamic data structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
eg. Linked list, stack, queue.

2. Non-linear data structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
eg. Trees, graphs

Complexities...........
1. Time Complexity: Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.
2. Space Complexity: Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code. 
You will also come across the term Auxiliary Space very commonly in DSA, which refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure.
The time required for executing a code depends on several factors, such as: 
a. The number of operations performed in the program, 
b. The speed of the device, and also 
c. The speed of data transfer if being executed on an online platform. 

So how can we determine which one is efficient? The answer is the use of asymptotic notation. 
Asymptotic notation is a mathematical tool that calculates the required time in terms of input size and does not require the execution of the code. 

Big-O Notation (Ο) – Big-O notation specifically describes the worst-case scenario.
Omega Notation (Ω) – Omega(Ω) notation specifically describes the best-case scenario.
Theta Notation (θ) – This notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm.



Algorithm - Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.
