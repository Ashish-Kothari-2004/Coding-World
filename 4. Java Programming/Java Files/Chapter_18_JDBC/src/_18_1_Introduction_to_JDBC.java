Java Database Connectivity: JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with
the database. It is a part of JavaSE (Java Standard Edition). JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect with the database.
There are four types of JDBC drivers:
1. JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver, (It has been removed)
2. Native Driver,
3. Network Protocol Driver, and
4. Thin Driver (Most efficient)

We can use JDBC API to handle database using Java program and can perform the following activities:
1. Connect to the database
2. Execute queries and update statements to the database
3. Retrieve the result received from the database.

The java.sql package contains classes and interfaces for JDBC API. A list of popular interfaces of JDBC API are given below:
1. Driver interface
3. Connection interface
4. Statement interface
5. PreparedStatement interface
6. CallableStatement interface
7. ResultSet interface
8. ResultSetMetaData interface
9. DatabaseMetaData interface
10. RowSet interface

A list of popular classes of JDBC API are given below:
1. DriverManager class
2. Blob class
3. Clob class
4. Types class

NOTE:
Application Programming Interface (API): An application programming interface (API), in the context of Java, is a collection
of pre-written packages, classes, and interfaces with their respective methods, fields and constructors.

The java.sql package contains classes and interfaces for JDBC API. A list of popular interfaces of JDBC API are given below:
1. Driver interface
3. Connection interface
4. Statement interface
5. PreparedStatement interface
6. CallableStatement interface
7. ResultSet interface
