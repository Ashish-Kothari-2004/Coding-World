File - In Java, a File is an abstract data type. A named location used to store related information
       is known as a File. In Java, with the help of File Class, we can work with files. This File Class
       is inside the java.io package. The File class can be used by creating an object of the class and
       then specifying the name of the file.

Why File Handling is Required ?
1. In simple words, file handling means reading and writing data to a file.
2. File Handling is an integral part of any programming language as file handling enables us to store the output
   of any particular program in a file and allows us to perform certain operations on it.


Streams in Java: In Java, a sequence of data is known as a stream. In Java, Stream is classified into two types, i.e.,
                 Byte Stream and Character Stream.

1. Byte Stream -> Byte Stream is mainly involved with byte data. A file handling process with a byte stream is a process
   in which an input is provided and executed with the byte data.
   A. Input Stream classes (Reads)
   B. Output Stream classes (Writes)

2. Character Stream -> Character Stream is mainly involved with character data. A file handling process with a character
stream is a process in which an input is provided and executed with the character data.
    A. Reader classes(Reads)
    B. Writer classes(Writes)
